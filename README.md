# SEIR-526-Portfolio-Project

Here is my repo containing all of the files I'll need to create my own personal website. I'm excited to showcase my skills on my first website built completely from scratch!

Skills I will implement on my site:
- Flexbox
- CSS grid
- Responsive design (mobile-first)
- jQuery and interactive design

In this repo you will find:
- Project timeline & functional components
- Wireframes for mobile, tablet, and desktop
- Minimal Viable Product and post-MVP
- index.html, style.css, script.js files
- Thoughts/progress diary
